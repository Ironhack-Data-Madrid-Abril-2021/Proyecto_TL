**Steps followed to clean the database:**
I have cleaned all the data frame following trying to fix the data and make it completely homogeneous. 
The first thing to do is to remove all duplicate data. Then analyze the important data to be able to continue with the corresponding analysis.

I have tried to see the valid data in the Data Frame to see the validity of the study and to be able to be more accurate in the study.
That is why I have added two columns to my database, one called sessions where I have grouped the data into Morning, Afternoon, Evening and Night. And the other one called months, where I have classified dates by months.


**Hypothesis explanations:**
+ The probability of been a fatal Shark attack, is higher on women
+ Have been reported more shark attacks with people between the ages of 15 and 35.
+ The most common shark attacks reported were by white sharks.
