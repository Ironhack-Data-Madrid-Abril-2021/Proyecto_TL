Introduction

The main objective of this project has been the transformation, cleaning and loading of data. For later, to make an analysis on shark attacks around the planet,
until 2018. The project is proposed to us with the following rules: 

- It is forbidden to delete columns.
- There can be no nulls, the data has to be homogeneous.
- Once clean â†’ Create a db, create a table, fill the table).


How data was modified?

When I downloaded the file, I found a rather messy database, with non-existent and null data. The steps I performed were as follows:

- Remove duplicate data.
- Remove the rows with null data.
- Change the names of the columns to code in a more comfortable way.
- Clean the columns that I have detected as essential, for its later analysis, through a segmentation of the answers (depending on the type of column).
