# TL project _ Shark attacks

### Dataset obtained from kaggle

Dear reader,


I this exercise you will find an example of how to clean some data and insert it into SQL using Python (interface used is Jupyter Notebook, but it is no mandatory to be as such).


The data was extracted from kaggle.com of sharks attack. Of course, there's a lot of data that it's either incorrect or might to be useful for any analysis one may perfom.


Hopefully the walkthrough explained over the several steps makes clear all the decisions taken.


Enjoy the reading!


Best regards,


Francisco Freire
