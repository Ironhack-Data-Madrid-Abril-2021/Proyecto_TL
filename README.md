**Steps followed to clean the database:**

+ I have cleaned the data base of the TL Project where columns where not allowed to be deleted. 
First of all I have analyzed the type of data I had on the database and I have conducted the data cleaning bearing in mind the analysis I wanted to do; which is about studying the following hypothesis: Shark attacks are common during winter mornings. 
That is why I have added two columns to my database, one called sessions where I have grouped the data into Morning, Afternoon, Evening and Night. And the other one called months, where I have classified dates by months.

+ I have imported the cleaned csv file to MySQL Workbench, where I created different tables to conduct the analysis of the hypothesis. 

**Hypothesis explanations:**
+ The hypothesis I wanted to study was: Shark attacks are common during winter mornings. 
+ After cleaning the csv file I have analyzed the using matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create the graphs. 
+ I have worked with the following columns to study my hypothesis: Fatal (Y/N), Months, Sessions. 
+ The hypothesis I wanted to study is null, and what we see is that Shark attacks are common during summer afternoons.
